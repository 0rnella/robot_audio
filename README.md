# 🧠 ESP32 Voice Input Project

This project captures audio using an INMP441 microphone connected to an ESP32-C3 board, processes it (e.g., sends it to AssemblyAI), and displays results (such as transcribed text or LED feedback). The goal is to have it send the transcribed text to an AI, have the AI respond, and use text-to-speech to output the sound as well.

## 🔌 Building Your Robot Step by Step!

Time to connect all the parts! We'll build this like LEGO - one piece at a time.

### Step 1: Set up your breadboard power 🔋
First, we need to give power to everything on our breadboard:
1. Take a wire and connect the ESP32's **3.3V** pin to the **red (+) strip** on your breadboard
2. Take another wire and connect the ESP32's **GND** pin to the **blue (-) strip** on your breadboard

*The red strip gives electricity, the blue strip brings it back to the controller.*

### Step 2: Connect your speaker to the amplifier 🔊
1. Connect the speaker's **red (+) wire** to the amplifier's **+ terminal**
2. Connect the speaker's **black (-) wire** to the amplifier's **- terminal**

*This is how your robot will make sound!*

### Step 3: Connect the button 🔘
1. Connect one side of the button to **GPIO 3** on your ESP32
2. Connect the other side of the button to the **blue (-) strip** on your breadboard

*This is how your robot will listen for button presses!*

### Step 4: Connect the microphone (INMP441) 🎤
1. Connect the microphone's **VCC** to the **red (+) strip** on your breadboard
2. Connect the microphone's **GND** to the **blue (-) strip** on your breadboard
3. Connect the microphone's **WS** to **GPIO 2** on your ESP32
4. Connect the microphone's **SCK** to **GPIO 1** on your ESP32
5. Connect the microphone's **SD** to **GPIO 0** on your ESP32

*This is how your robot will hear you!*

### Step 5: Connect the amplifier (MAX98357A) 📢
1. Connect the amplifier's **VCC** to the **red (+) strip** on your breadboard
2. Connect the amplifier's **GND** to the **blue (-) strip** on your breadboard
3. Connect the amplifier's **DIN** to **GPIO 7** on your ESP32
4. Connect the amplifier's **BCLK** to **GPIO 9** on your ESP32
5. Connect the amplifier's **LRC** to **GPIO 10** on your ESP32

*This is how your robot will talk back to you!*
